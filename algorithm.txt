solve (board) -> return board if completed, false / whatever if it cant


if board is full
    return true     / We've filled up the board with valid moves

for each choice on board # try every single choice
    select valid choice
        if (solve (board with new valid choice))
            this choice pathway is valid, and solves it
            return true
    deselect choice / this pathway doesnt work

return false  / exhausted every valid choice



useful funcs to make:
valid_move_list() -> returns a list of valid numbers a cell can take
