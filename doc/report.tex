\textbf{Summary of the intermediate submission:}

\bigskip

\noindent For this assignment, my partner and I used the backtracking algorithm in order
to solve for the problem. Our program reads in a text file that conatins the 
number of rows and columns as well as a list of the values that the matrix will
be made up of. The values will be read in by row,

\[R_{00},R_{01},R_{02},R_{03},R_{10},R_{11},R_{12},R_{13},R_{20},R_{21},R_{22},R_{23},R_{30},R_{31},R_{32},R_{33}\]

\noindent The values are then placed in their repsective places in the n $\times$ n matrix.
The initial empty spaces hold a value of 0, the algorithm will search for the 0's 
in the matrix and replace them with their correct value. We chose to use a backtracking
algorithm in order to solve this problem. The psuedo-code for our solution is posted above.
The solution that we came to is our original code.
